// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers 
add the 2 number together 
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

 Enter num.
 Read value of num.
 Divide num by 2.
IF remainder is 0, display "Even number".
ELSE display "Odd number".
 

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

a)Enter num1, num2, num3, num4, num5
  Read num1, num2, num3, num4, num5

b)Add num1+num2+num3+num4+num5=sum
  Divide the sum by 5
       sum/5=avg
  Display avg

c)Small=n1  
  Large=n1
  for i=2 to 5:
    IF n1>ni then:
      small=ni
    IF n1<ni then:
      large=ni

d)Display ("Average:",avg)
  Display ("Smallest:",min)
  Display ("Largest:",max)
